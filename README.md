## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset using Python to understand its structure, quality, and underlying patterns. The analysis focuses on identifying missing values, understanding data types, summarizing numerical and categorical features, detecting duplicates, and analyzing relationships between numerical variables using correlation analysis and visualization.

The goal is to prepare the dataset for further modeling or business analysis by gaining meaningful insights from raw data.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Check for missing (null) values and data consistency
- Understand data types and structure
- Generate summary statistics for numerical and categorical features
- Identify unique values and duplicate records
- Analyze relationships between numerical variables
- Visualize correlations using a heatmap
  
## 🧪 Analysis Tasks Performed

### 1. Data Quality Checks
- Checked for missing (null) values in the dataset
- Identified data types of each column
- Detected duplicate rows

### 2. Summary Statistics
- Generated statistical summaries for numerical features using `describe()`
- Analyzed categorical features using `describe(include='object')`
- Evaluated the number of unique values in each column

### 3. Correlation Analysis
- Selected numerical columns only
- Computed correlation matrix
- Visualized correlations using a heatmap
  
## 📊 Key Analysis Outputs
- Statistical summary (mean, median, standard deviation, min, max)
- Frequency and distribution of categorical variables
- Count of unique values per column
- Total duplicate rows in the dataset
- Correlation matrix for numerical features
- Correlation heatmap for visual interpretation
  
## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib** – Data visualization
- **Seaborn** – Statistical visualization
  
## 📈 Visualization 
- Correlation heatmap to identify relationships between numerical variables
- Visual support for feature selection and data understanding
